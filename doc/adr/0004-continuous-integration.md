# 4. continuous integration

Date: 2023-10-31

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The challenge is time-boxed, so I need a fast feedback to ensure that the project still compiles and the tests are passing.

## Decision

Use GitHub Actions to run the tests on every push to the main branch.

## Consequences

Overkill for a code challenge? Maybe, but I think that it is a good practice to have a CI in place.
